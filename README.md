Perseverance, a game written in Processing (Java).

The player simultaneously controls an astronaut on Mars and the Perseverance rover, where the rover mirrors the astronaut's movement. To complete a level, you must reach the end of the level in time with the rover's health in tact.

The user will only be able to complete the game having made a sufficient number of upgrades, as they continually redo their attempts until they can complete each level.

The level creator allows players to add their own levels to the game non-programmatically.
